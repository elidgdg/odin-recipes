    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>James Hoffmann won the 2007 World Barista Championship and founded Square Mile Coffee Roasters. This is his method for mimicking an espresso using the AeroPress.</p>

    <h2>What you need</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Inverted AeroPress</li>
        <li>18g dark roast, fine ground coffee</li>
        <li>90g water 100C</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place a paper filter in the cap and rinse with hot water.</li>
        <li>Add 18 g of ground coffee to the brew chamber. It should be ground fairly fine (a bit coarser than an espresso grind).</li>
        <li>Pour 90 g of hot water over the grounds.</li>
        <li>Stir to remove any clumps, a little bit aggressively.</li>
        <li>Fasten the filter cap and let sit.</li>
        <li>Flip the AeroPress and press gently into a cup. Keep pressing all the way through the hissing.</li>
    </ol>
