      <img src="../img/frenchpress.png" alt="french press" width="300px">

      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>A cylindrical pot with a plunger and built-in filter screen that presses hot water through ground coffee: that’s the simple beauty of the French press, method of choice for many all over the world, creating an earthy, rich taste in your daily cup of coffee.
      </p>
      <p>The secret is all in the grind: choose medium, with uniformity and consistency throughout.  Very coarse grinds may clog the filter, while very fine grinds will pass through the filter, muddying the results.</p>

      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Place the pot on a dry, flat surface. Hold the handle firmly, then pull out the plunger</li>
        <li>Add a heaping tablespoon (7-8 grams) of coffee to the pot per 200 ml (6.7 oz) of water</li>
        <li>Pour hot water—not quite boiling—into the pot, and gently stir</li>
        <li>Carefully reinsert the plunger into the pot, stopping just above the water and ground coffee (do not plunge yet), and let stand for 3-4 minutes </li>
        <li>Press the plunger down slowly, exerting steady pressure</li>
        <li>After each use, wash the pot with water and mild detergent, and dry thoroughly</li>
      </ol>
